##  What Is InterviewAI?

InterviewAI helps software engineers and students **practice technical interviews** in a realistic, pressure-free environment. You configure your interview (role, difficulty, topic), chat with an AI interviewer, and receive an instant coaching report — all in your browser.

**Why it's useful:**
-  Adaptive questions that follow your answers, just like a real interview
-  Instant feedback after every response — no waiting days for results
-  End-of-session performance report covering communication, accuracy, and confidence
-  Unlimited practice — same tech, different questions every time
